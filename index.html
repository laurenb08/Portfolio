            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 30 year old mom of 1 and I love to hike, camp, play board games, and workout!</p>
            <p>In my professional life, I love to work on teams, solve puzzles, and be creative. I have dabbled in coding for several years but got serious about it in 2020 and have fallen in love. It's challenging and exciting and has been a very fulfilling experience for me so far. I'm excited to start making my mark on the world and having a positive impact on others through the world of coding.</p>
            <p>Please take a look at my projects below, I hope you enjoy them!</p>
